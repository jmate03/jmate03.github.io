                <h2>Problem Statement : Washing Machine Vacancy Notifier</h2>
            </a>
            <p>People who use public washing and laundry machines never know if or when a unit will be open. This leads
                to frustration from many people who go all the way to these units, not knowing that they wouldnâ€™t be
                able to use them. Our goal is to create a solution to this problem and have a way for people to know
                whether a washing or laundry machine unit is open before they go to them.
